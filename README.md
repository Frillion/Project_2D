# Project_2D

### Log 1: 
<br>Made this repo, Looked at and downloaded some assets from 
<br>the store that could be usefull and made the project itself.

### Log 2: 
<br>Imported The Assets That i got from the unity store and made a small little environment, 
<br>will be working on making the character next.

### Log 3:
<br>Made A Player Character in its own sorting layer and made very basic movement 
<br>No Animations Have Been Made And the assets that i got are not eligible for 
<br>rigging so ill use sprite swaping instead.

# Project_2D

### Log 1: 
<br>Made this repo, Looked at and downloaded some assets from 
<br>the store that could be usefull and made the project itself.

### Log 2: 
<br>Imported The Assets That i got from the unity store and made a small little environment, 
<br>will be working on making the character next.

### Log 3:
<br>Made A Player Character in its own sorting layer and made very basic movement 
<br>No Animations Have Been Made And the assets that i got are not eligible for 
<br>rigging so ill use sprite swaping instead.

### Log 4:
<br>Game Is Doing Better Than Expected. 
<br>Made The Final iteration of the basic movement system for the game movement feels nice and fluent.
<br>Might add a wall jump later though if i have the time to implement that.
<br>All Animations are completed for the player character and the animators references in the script in the
<br>Animate() function.
<br>Along with the animations came the addition of the basic attack(The Animations handle the hitbox of the weapon).
<br>Next is to work on the ninjas abillity to shoot fire
